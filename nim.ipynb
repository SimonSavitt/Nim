    "# Nim with a Quantum Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "[Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) is a simple game for which we can implement simple AIs. For that reason it was used as the basis of some of the first examples of computer games: such as 1940's [Nimatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimatron) and 1951's [Nimrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_(computer)). There was even [Dr Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Nim): a simple mechanical version made in the 1960s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to do it with quantum computing. In this notebook we'll implement a Nim AI using just a single qubit. The game can be played here, or on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we import the things we'll need: `numpy`, various things from `qiskit` and some `twitter_tools` made specifically for this project (which can be found in the file [twitter_tools.py](twitter_tools.py))."

    "To implement an AI for Player 2, we mostly just need to be able to determine when the number of marbles is a multiple of 4. For a quantum computer, we can do this using one qubit (as long as we can repeat the process for many shots. If you are not familiar with single qubit gates, [this guide](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/blog/blob/master/Quantum_Procedural_Generation/2_SingleQubit.ipynb) should give you all you need for what follows.\n",

There are therefore three possible numbers of marbles that could be taken at the end of the turn: `nimmed+1`, `nimmed+2` or `nimmed+3`. The quantum AI then runs three circuits: one with `nimmed+1` `rx` gates, one with `nimmed+2` and one with `nimmed+3`.  It looks at the results of each to see which returns the most `0` outputs. Given the results we saw above, this will be the one such that the total number of marbles taken is a multiple of four (assuming that one of the moves can acheive this).\n",
